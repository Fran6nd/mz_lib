# MazeCurses
A simple maze game in terminal, written in C and featuring a generator.<br>
I made this project for the challenge of implementing an algo I did in Java and Js.<br>
It's using the size available in the terminal.<br>
It's really the fastes I did for now!<br>
I'm open for any continution to improve it.<br>

# How to use?

You will need the lib `ncurses` to build the project.<br>
On debian distros, use the following command to install the lib:<br>
`sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`<br>
<br>
Then:<br>
Run `make mz_curses` to build the demo program.<br>
Run `./dist/mz_curses -h` to see help.<br>
